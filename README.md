<h1>Tracing Malicious Activity in Windows OS</h1>

<h2>Brief Description</h2>
<p>The desktop PC under investigation was seized from a suspect suspected of utilizing the PlagueRat commodity malware to target an IT services company. A forensic disk copy has been captured, and the analysis aims to determine if PlagueRat was employed. Specific questions guide the investigation, including identifying the full file name of PlagueRat, details about its ZIP file, and examining the contents within. Additional inquiries involve analyzing the PlagueRat process in prefetch files and exploring the user's Jump List to determine accessed websites and the associated browser.

This project provides a practical scenario for digital forensics professionals to uncover critical evidence, aiding in the conviction of a malicious hacker. The investigation delves into multiple aspects of system artifacts, showcasing the utilization of advanced tools and methodologies to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the suspect's activities.</p>
